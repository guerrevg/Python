labels: ["documentation", "good first issue"]

## Issue

Several topic folders lack README.md files explaining what learners will find there.

## Folders Missing README

- `basics/09_error_handling/`
- `basics/10_advanced/`
- `basics/11_projects/`
- `basics/12_web/`

## Expected

Each folder should have a README.md with:
1. Brief topic introduction
2. List of files and what they do
3. How to run examples
4. Practice exercises

## Example Template

```markdown
# Topic: Error Handling

## What You'll Learn
- Try/except blocks
- Raising exceptions
- Error types

## Files
- `01_try_except.py` - Basic error handling
- `02_raise_exception.py` - Custom exceptions

## Run Examples
```bash
python 01_try_except.py
```

## Practice
1. Add error handling to your previous code
2. Create custom exception classes
```

## Files to Create
- `basics/09_error_handling/README.md`
- `basics/10_advanced/README.md`
- `basics/11_projects/README.md`
- `basics/12_web/README.md`
