"""
Problem: GameCharacter class
Create a class called GameCharacter with:
🔒 Private variables: _name, _level, _health
✅ Rules:
   - Level: Must be between 1 and 50
   - Health: Must be between 0 and 100
   - Name: Cannot be empty
🧠 What you must implement:
   - __init__ method
   - Getter for all three
   - Setter for all three with validation
   - Print values using getters
   - Update values using setters
